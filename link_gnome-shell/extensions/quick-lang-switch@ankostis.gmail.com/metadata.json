  "description": "Quickly switch keyboard language layout without showing the switcher popup.\n\nThe language switcher popup by default takes ~0.7sec to appear, meaning that roughly 2-4 strokes are lost till the switch completes. This affects heavily users typing languages with non-latin based alphabets (e.g. Greek, Cyrilic, Arabic, Japanese), particularly when writting technical documents.\nThis extension reduces the switching time to 1/10th of a second (on a 2019 PC).  It fixes also focus issues with the active window.",
